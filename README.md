# RigidCharacterBody3D Class
A character controller class for Godot 4.5 similar to the CharacterBody3D class except moved through force and impulse application.
The class script includes:
 * Full documentation
 * Floor, wall, and ceiling detection
 * Slope handling
 * AnimatableBody3D handling

The project includes:
 * A test range (textured using Kenney's Prototype Textures)
 * A player example scene and script
## Notes
 * The code does not particularly use anything specific from Godot 4.5, so it is possible to use the class for earlier versions.
 * The project uses Jolt
